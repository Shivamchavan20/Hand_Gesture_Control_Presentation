# Hand_Gesture_Control_Presentation
This project presents the development and implementation of a hand gesture-based presentation system using OpenCV and Python. System aims to provide seamless and intuitive user experience for controlling presentation through hand gesture, eliminating the need for traditional presentation tools such as keyboards or clickers. By using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithm, the system can recognize specific hand gesture to perform action such as moving slide forward and backward as well as controlling a pointer and drawing capabilities on the slides.
